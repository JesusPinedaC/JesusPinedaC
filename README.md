#### Hi :wave:! 

**I'm Jes√∫s**, a Doctoral Researcher at the Department of Physics of the University of Gothenburg (Sweden), working on deep learning and microscopy.  

My research interests include machine learning, quantitative microscopy, and medical and biomedical image processing. More specifically, my research involves exemplifying how to employ deep learning for a broad range of cell imaging applications, from cell localization, tracking, and characterization to cell counting, segmentation, and virtual staining. 

I am a core developer of the deep learning software package for microscopy DeepTrack 2.0.
